# Social Good & Human Experience Track
The gridlock of not knowing what to do or where to go is a problem often faced today. 
That's why our team invented Move, a website that lets you see other people's itineraries for inspiration.
It also shows you what the most common attraction is around a certain time period and what your friends often did after going to certain attractions.
This enhances the human experience by connecting you to your friends or even strangers by living your day as they did.

React and Flask were used to create a highly interactive frontend, while MongoDB and Python were used to store the itineraries and to organize them to suggest activities well.

To run the code, a virtual environment must be set up and the applications in the requirements.txt file should be installed.

## Setting up Virtual Environment
1. Type **python --version** in bash to make sure python is installed. If not, install python at python.org.
2. Create a folder for the virtual environment with mkdir and then type **python -m venv venv** in the directory.
3. To activate the virtual environment, type **venv\Scripts\activate**.
4. Install the dependencies with **pip install -r requirements.txt**.

## Frontend
To run the frontend, go to the README in the frontend folder.
